What does friendship mean?

It means communication...

day or night.

Sticking together

through the good times...

and the bad.

Creating our own little worlds...

or infinities in this case.

Defining our own style...

even if people look at us funny.

Laughing at the things we love

without asking if it made sense.

Sharing seconds

but not looking at the clock.

Just Jammin' out

and letting the good times roll

Giggling at our failures

and glorifying our successes



and telling the world.
